# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch

jobs:

  Build_Docker_Image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
